This is a demo site for [fragment-plugin](https://github.com/swup/fragment-plugin), a [swup](https://github.com/swup/) plugin for dynamically updating fragments based on custom rules.


Under <a href="/characters/">Characters</a>, you can find a filterable list of super mario characters. Note how only the <code>#characters-list</code> is replaced when filtering characters. How a single character opens in a <code>#character-modal</code>. How only the <code>#character-detail</code> is being replaced when navigating between characters, without touching any other element.

**All this is is the work of the Fragment Plugin! ðŸ§©**
