_Progressively convert your classic website into a single-page-app_

This is a completely over-the-top demo-site that was built to show what you can do with these tools:

- [Swup](https://github.com/swup/swup/), a versatile and extensible **page transition library** for server-rendered websites.
- [Fragment Plugin](https://github.com/swup/fragment-plugin), a swup plugin for **dynamically updating fragments** based on rules.

Under <a href="/characters/">Characters</a>, you can find a filterable list of super mario characters. Note how only the <code>#characters-list</code> is replaced when filtering characters. How a single character opens in a <code>#character-modal</code>. How only the <code>#character-detail</code> is being replaced when navigating between characters, without touching any other element.

**All this is is the work of the Fragment Plugin! ðŸ§©**
