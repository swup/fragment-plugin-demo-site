- [Swup](https://github.com/swup/swup/) is a versatile and extensible **page transition library** for server-rendered websites.
- [Fragment Plugin](https://github.com/swup/fragment-plugin) is a swup plugin for **dynamically updating fragments** based on rules.


Under <a href="/characters/">Characters</a>, you can find a filterable list of super mario characters. Note how only the <code>#characters-list</code> is replaced when filtering characters. How a single character opens in a <code>#character-modal</code>. How only the <code>#character-detail</code> is being replaced when navigating between characters, without touching any other element.

**All this is is the work of the Fragment Plugin! ðŸ§©**
