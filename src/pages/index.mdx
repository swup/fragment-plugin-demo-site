This is a demo and test site for the <a href="https://github.com/swup/fragment-plugin">fragment plugin</a> for <a href="https://github.com/swup/">swup</a>.

Under <a href="/characters/">Characters</a>, you can find a filterable list of super mario characters. Note how only the <code>#characters-list</code> is replaced when filtering characters. How a single character opens in a <code>#character-modal</code>. How only the <code>#character-detail</code> is being replaced when navigating between characters, without touching any other element.

<strong>All this is is the work of the Fragment Plugin! ðŸ§©</strong>
