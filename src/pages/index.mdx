This is a demo for the for <a href="https://github.com/swup/fragment-plugin">fragment-plugin</a>, a <a href="https://github.com/swup/">swup</a> plugin for dynamically updating elements based on custom rules ðŸ§©


Under <a href="/characters/">Characters</a>, you can find a filterable list of super mario characters. Note how only the <code>#characters-list</code> is replaced when filtering characters. How a single character opens in a <code>#character-modal</code>. How only the <code>#character-detail</code> is being replaced when navigating between characters, without touching any other element.

<strong>All this is is the work of the Fragment Plugin!</strong>

## Use cases

All of the following scenarios require updating only a small content fragment instead of performing a full page transition:

- a filter UI that live-updates its list of results on every interaction
- a detail overlay that shows on top of the currently open content
- a tab group that should update only itself upon clicking one of the tabs
