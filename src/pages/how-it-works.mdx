## Installation

```bash
npm install swup @swup/fragment-plugin
```

### Fragment support on this site is being achieved with:

1. [JavaScript](#javascript) for setting up fragment rules
2. [CSS](#css) for animating fragment visits
3. The [DOM](#dom) for special cases and extra functionality

## JavaScript

The following code is being used on this very site for initializing swup with fragment support:

<Code code={JS} lang="js" />

Did you notice something strange about rule 3? It's telling the plugin to
not only replace the `#character-modal` but also the `#characters-list`! Surely that's
not we want when we are closing a character, right?

Turns out: There are cases where we actually want that! When navigating from a character to
filter that wasn't active before we opened the character. Or when jumping multiple steps backwards
or forwards in the browser history.

**Fragment Plugin keeps track of the URL for each fragment as soon as it is being rendered.
On subsequent visits, the fragment won't be replaced if it already matches the visit's URL.**

## CSS

The CSS for the animations of fragment visits is scoped to the fragment elements:

<Code code={CSS} lang="css" />

## DOM

### [data-swup-fragment-url]

Let's visit one of the character detail pages directly,
<a href="/character/luigi/" target="_blank">Luigi</a>, for example.

On that page, the `#characters-list` behind the `#character-modal` displays the items that would also be
rendered when navigating towards `/characters/`. But there is no way for Fragment Plugin to automatically
detect that fact, so it would replace the list upon closing the modal, following our third fragment rule:

```js
{
  from: "/character/:character",
  to: "/characters/:filter?",
  containers: ["#character-modal", "#characters-list"],
  name: "close-character",
}
```

We can solve this by providing the URL of the `#characters-list` beforehand, by adding
`data-swup-fragment-url="/characters/"` to it. Now Fragment Plugin can correctly skip the
`#characters-list` when we navigate from the open `#character-modal` to `/characters/`:

```html title="/character/luigi/index.html" 'data-swup-fragment-url="/characters/"'
<main id="character-modal">
	<!-- ...modal content... -->
</main>
<div id="characters-list" data-swup-fragment-url="/characters/">
	<!-- ...filters & characters... -->
</div>
```

### [data-swup-link-to-fragment]

Using `[data-swup-link-to-fragment="<fragment-selector>"]`, you can tell any link on your site to be synced
to the matching element's fragment URL. This is in use for the modal's close links on this site:

```html title="/character/luigi/index.html" 'data-link-to-fragment="#characters-list"'
<main id="character-modal">
  <!-- Tells the link to sync it's `href` to the fragment #characters-list: -->
	<a href="" data-link-to-fragment="#characters-list">Close modal</a>
</main>
<div id="characters-list" data-swup-fragment-url="/characters/">
	<!-- ...filters & characters... -->
</div>
```

### Modals inside `transform`ed parents

Suppose you have a fragment that you want to open like a modal, above all other content:

```html {10-15}
<div id="swup" class="transition-main">
  <!-- This should be placed above everything else, like a modal -->
  <div id="item-detail" class="modal">
    <main>
      <h1>Item 1</h1>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor...</p>
    </main>
  </div>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/item/1/">Item 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="/item/2/">Item 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="/item/3/">Item 3</a></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>
```

You might have this (minimal) CSS to make the `#item-detail` appear as a modal above everything else:

```css
.modal {
  position: fixed;
  inset: 0;
  z-index: 99999;
}
```

This will work fine, until you apply a `transform` to any of the modal's parent elements:

```css {7}
html.is-changing .transition-main {
  transition: opacity 250ms, transform 250ms;
}
html.is-animating .transition-main {
  opacity: 0;
  /* `transform` will misplace the .modal's positioning during an animated page visit */
  transform: translateY(20px);
}
```

The reason for this is that `transform` establishes a [containing block for all descendants](https://www.w3.org/TR/css-transforms-1/#containing-block-for-all-descendants).

You have two options to fix this:

1. Don't apply CSS `transform`s to any of the parents of a modal
2. Use `<detail open>` for the modal:

```diff lang="html"
<div id="swup" class="transition-main">
  <!-- This should be placed above everything else, like a modal -->
- <div id="item-detail" class="modal">
+ <dialog open id="item-detail" class="modal">
    <main>
      <h1>Item 1</h1>
      <p>Lorem ipsum dolor...</p>
    </main>
- </div>
+ </dialog>
  <section>
    <ul>
      <li><a href="/item/1/">Item 1</a></li>
      <li><a href="/item/2/">Item 2</a></li>
      <li><a href="/item/3/">Item 3</a></li>
    </ul>
  </section>
</div>
```

Fragment Plugin will detect `<detail open>` fragment elements automatically on every page view and run [`showModal()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLDialogElement/showModal) on them, putting them on the [top layer](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Top_layer) and thus allows them to not be affected by parent element styles, anymore.

## Modals and accessibility

### Element order

The first `<main>` element in a document will be considered the main content by assistive technology. If you are using the [A11y Plugin](https://swup.js.org/plugins/a11y-plugin/), that's also the element that will automatically be focused upon page visits. For that reason, **you should always put your modal before any overlayed content**, if it should be considered the primary content of a page.

### Pros and cons of using a `<dialog open>` element for modals

**Pros**:

- The modal's positioning won't be affected by `transform` animations on any of it's parents.
- Focus trapping will be natively available for the modal without you having to do anything.

**Cons**:

- Wrapping your `<main>` content inside a `<dialog>` will produce [semantically incorrect markup](https://stackoverflow.com/a/75007908/586823). We still think it's the cleanest approach for now, until the [Popover API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Popover_API) reaches [wider browser support](https://caniuse.com/?search=popover).
