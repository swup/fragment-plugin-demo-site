## Installation

```bash
npm install swup @swup/fragment-plugin
```

### Fragment support on this site is being achieved with:

1. [JavaScript](#javascript) for setting up fragment rules
2. [CSS](#css) for animating fragment visits
3. The [DOM](#dom) for special cases and extra functionality

## JavaScript

The following code is being used on this very site for initializing swup with fragment support:

<Code code={JS} lang="js" />

Did you notice something strange about rule 3? It's telling the plugin to
not only replace the `#overlay` but also the `#list`! Surely that's
not we want when we are closing an overlay, right?

Turns out: There are cases where we actually want that! When navigating to another
filter from an overlay, for example. Or when jumping multiple steps backwards or forwards
in the browser history.

**Fragment Plugin keeps track of the URL for each fragment as soon as it is being rendered.
On subsequent visits, the fragment won't be replaced if it already matches the visit's URL.**

## CSS

The CSS for the animations of fragment visits is scoped to the fragments:

<Code code={CSS} lang="css" />

## DOM

### [data-swup-fragment-url]

Let's visit one of the character detail pages directly,
<a href="/character/luigi/" target="_blank">Luigi</a>, for example.

The overlayed `#list` on that page displays the items that would be rendered when
navigating towards `/characters/`. But there is no way for Fragment Plugin to automatically
detect that fact, so it would replace the list upon closing the overlay.

We can solve this by providing the URL of the `#list` beforehand, by adding
the attribute `data-swup-fragment-url="/characters/"` to it. Now Fragment Plugin
can correctly skip the `#list` when we navigate from the overlay to `/characters/`:

```html title="/character/luigi/index.html" 'data-swup-fragment-url="/characters/"'
<main id="overlay">
	<!-- ...overlay content... -->
</main>
<div id="list" data-swup-fragment-url="/characters/">
	<!-- ...filters & characters... -->
</div>
```

### [data-swup-link-to-fragment]

Using `[data-swup-link-to-fragment="<fragment-selector>"]`, you can tell any link on your site to be synced to the value of `[data-swup-fragment-url]`
of the fragment matching the provided selector. This is in use for the overlay close buttons on this site:

```html title="/character/luigi/index.html" 'data-link-to-fragment="#list"'
<main id="overlay">
  <!-- Tells the link to sync it's `href` to the fragment #list: -->
	<a href="" data-link-to-fragment="#list">Close overlay</a>
</main>
<div id="list" data-swup-fragment-url="/characters/">
	<!-- ...filters & characters... -->
</div>
```
